# üß† An Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System for Depression Diagnosis

The project aims to develop an **Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System** for **depression diagnosis** as a potential tool to support mental health specialists.<br><br>
The system takes five input variables:
- **PHQ-9 Score**
- **BDI Score**
- **GAD-7 Score**
- **Sleep Quality**
- **Social Interactions** <br>

As output, it returns the **Depression Level**.

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Warning

**This system is intended for preliminary assessment only. A comprehensive diagnosis should always be conducted by a qualified medical specialist.**

## üìö About This Project

This project was completed as the final assignment within for the *Fuzzy Systems* course during my engineering studies.

## üß∞ Development Tools

- Python 3.12.2
- [PyIT2FLS](https://pyit2fls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) (Jupyter Notebook)

## üìä Results

For example, given the following input values:
- **PHQ-9 Score: 10**
- **BDI Score: 7**
- **GAD-7 Score: 5**
- **Sleep Quality: 1**
- **Social Interactions: 2**

### Charts:<br>

- The first chart shows which rules was activated:<br>

After **defuzzification**, the system output a **rounded value of 32**, which corresponds to a **Low Depression Level**.
